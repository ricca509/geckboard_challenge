## What's included:
- react
- react-router
- Alt.js
- Karma
- Babel
- webpack

## How you use it

You need `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server` installed globally.

```
$ npm install webpack -g
```
```
$ npm install webpack-dev-server -g
```

To install deps:
```
$ npm install
```

To run tests:
```
$ karma start
```

To see the result:
```
$ webpack
```
then open `index.html`

Or, easier
```
$ webpack-dev-server
```
then open [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/repos/<github_username>)


Hey Geckoboard geeks,
thanks for giving me the opportunity to do the challenge.
As you'll find out, I am using react and one of the many implementations of flux (alt.js).
I decided to finish the implementation, showing you the way I set up an application and perform non-trivial tasks.

I used my [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/ricca509/react-alt-karma-es6-webpack) to kick start the project.

You can find tests in every folder: since the time was running out I decided to cherrypick components
and module to test, to show you how I test different part of applications.
For a more complete example I can link you other repos I have.

Open to discuss any part of the implementation with you at any time.

Enjoy!
